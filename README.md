# CubicSplines


 Cubic Splines: Given a set of points find the coefficients of all the 3rd
degree polynomials that go through all the given points using the cubic
splines method.
Input:
Sample input representing the points (1, 5),(2, 6),(3, 6.5),(4, 5.5),(5, 5.5),(6, 7)

where the first number corresponds to the number of points.
Output:
(a) Coefficients of nâˆ’1 polynomials. The coefficients of each polynomial
in a row separated by spaces (see lecture notes for lecture 14):
5 1.014354 0 -0.014354
6 0.971291667 -0.043062 -0.42822967
6.5 -0.39952167 -1.327751 0.727272667
5.5 -0.87320567 0.854067 0.019138667
5.5 0.89234467 0.911483 -0.30382767
(b) A plot like the one shown on lecture notes
