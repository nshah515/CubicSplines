# CubicSplines


Simpson’s Rule: Compute the definite integral of a given function using
the Composite Simpson’s rule.
Input: Function (of x) as a string (use matlab’s inline and feval), the
limits of integration (a and b), and the number of subintervals. Sample
input:
x^3
1
5
20
Output: The approximate value of
Z b
a
f(x)dx
using Simpson’s rule with n subintervals
